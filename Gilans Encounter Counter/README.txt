Welcome to Gilan's Encounter Counter!

Details of development can be found here: https://forums.pokemmo.eu/index.php?/topic/137452-tool-gilans-encounter-counter-preview/

First and foremost, any attempt to redistribute my code / application, with or without modification, without prior explicit permission by me (Gilan - https://forums.pokemmo.eu/index.php?/profile/47988-gilan/) is strictly prohibited.
If you received this program from any source other than those above, please exercise caution, as my program could have been tampered with to cause harm to your system.

You should have installed this application package to your ./PokeMMO/data/mods/ folder. Your total project path should look like "./PokeMMO/data/mods/Gilan Encounter Counter", if it instead looks like 
"./PokeMMO/data/mods/GEC Package/Gilan Encounter Counter", please copy and paste the Gilan Encounter Counter folder to be right under /mods/

To run the application, go to "./PokeMMO/data/mods/Gilan Encounter Counter/GEC/GEC.exe" and run the executable. You can create a shortcut to your desktop for easier access.
You can also create a batch file to open the encounter counter alongside PokeMMO if you so wish.

If you have further questions, please visit the forums.pokemmo.eu link above.

Hope you enjoy this tool!
