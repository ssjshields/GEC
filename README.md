# Requirements
- Custom strings must have properly formatted headers
- Custom themes require an additional patch, see release notes

&nbsp;

# Installation
1. Extract `GEC.Package.zip` into `PokeMMO\data\mods`
2. Launch `PokeMMO\data\mods\Gilans Encounter Counter\GEC\GEC.exe`

&nbsp;

# Custom Theme Patch Installation
1. Create a folder in `PokeMMO\data\themes` with the same name as the `name=` line in the custom theme's `info.xml`
2. Extract the contents of the `GEC.Custom.Theme.Patch.zip` into the newly created folder

&nbsp;

# Patch Explanation
After implementing the patch and fully restarting PokeMMO / GEC, it should work again with custom themes.  

This fix will not work if the theme name mismatches the folder name you created.

The folder/zip/mod management name is not relevant to the actual theme name.

This collection of files essentially tricks the application into working again.
