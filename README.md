# Requirements
- Windows 8/10/11 64-bit
- [Latest Python Release](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Custom strings must have properly formatted headers
- Custom themes require an additional patch, see below

&nbsp;

# Installation
1. Extract `Gilans Encounter Counter` into `PokeMMO\data\mods`
2. Launch `PokeMMO\data\mods\Gilans Encounter Counter\GEC\GEC.exe`

&nbsp;

# Custom Theme Patch Installation
1. Extract `GEC Custom Theme Patch` into `PokeMMO\data\themes`
2. Rename `GEC Custom Theme Patch` to the same name as the `name=` line in the custom theme's `info.xml`

&nbsp;

# Patch Explanation
After implementing the patch and fully restarting PokeMMO / GEC, it should work again with custom themes.  

This fix will not work if the theme name mismatches the folder name you created.

The folder/zip/mod management name is not relevant to the actual theme name.
